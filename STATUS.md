# nanoGPT Assignment Part 2 - Current Status

## ✅ COMPLETE SETUP

All 128 experiments have been configured and are running automatically!

### What's Been Done

1. ✅ **Cloned nanoGPT repository**
2. ✅ **Prepared Shakespeare dataset**
3. ✅ **Created folder structure** for 4 group members
4. ✅ **Generated 128 configuration files** (32 per member)
5. ✅ **Created automation scripts** for running and analyzing experiments
6. ✅ **Started running all 128 experiments** in the background
7. ✅ **Created analysis and visualization tools**

## 📊 Experiment Configuration

### Distribution:
- **Member 1**: 32 experiments (block_size=64, n_layer=4)
- **Member 2**: 32 experiments (block_size=64, n_layer=6)
- **Member 3**: 32 experiments (block_size=128, n_layer=4)
- **Member 4**: 32 experiments (block_size=128, n_layer=6)

### Hyperparameters Tested:
- `n_head`: 4, 8
- `n_embd`: 128, 256
- `batch_size`: 8, 16
- `max_iters`: 25, 50 (reduced for quick testing)
- `dropout`: 0.1, 0.2

### Total: 2^5 = 32 combinations per member × 4 members = **128 experiments**

## 🛠️ Tools Available

### 1. Analyze Results
```bash
python analyze_results.py
```
Shows statistics, best results, and saves CSV files

### 2. Visualize Results
```bash
python visualize_results.py
```
Creates plots for loss curves, hyperparameter comparisons, and overfitting analysis

### 3. Run Experiments (if needed)
```bash
# All experiments
python run_all_experiments.py

# Single member
python run_member_experiments.py 1  # for member 1
```

## 📈 Monitoring Progress

### Check completion status:
```bash
# Count completed experiments
find experiments -name "*.log" -type f | wc -l

# Quick analysis
python analyze_results.py

# View specific log
cat experiments/member1/logs/exp_001_*.log
```

### View visualizations:
All plots are saved as PNG files in the `experiments/` directory.

## 📝 For Your Report

### Include These Results:

1. **Tables**:
   - `experiments/analysis_results.csv` - Full results
   - `experiments/best_configurations.csv` - Top performers

2. **Plots**:
   - `experiments/hyperparameter_comparison.png` - Impact analysis
   - `experiments/overfitting_analysis.png` - Overfitting study
   - `experiments/member*/loss_curves.png` - Training curves

3. **Text Samples**: Generate from best models
   ```bash
   cd nanoGPT
   python sample.py --init_from=resume \
     --out_dir=../experiments/member1/results/exp_015_* \
     --num_samples=5
   ```

### Key Analysis Points:

#### 1. Architecture Impact:
- **Larger embeddings** (256 vs 128): Better performance but more parameters
- **More layers** (6 vs 4): Compare member1 vs member2
- **Block size** (128 vs 64): Compare member1 vs member3

#### 2. Training Impact:
- **More iterations** (50 vs 25): Better convergence
- **Dropout** (0.1 vs 0.2): Regularization effect
- **Batch size** (16 vs 8): Stability vs updates

#### 3. Overfitting:
- Look at `val_train_gap` in results
- Positive gap = overfitting
- Negative gap = underfitting or continued learning
